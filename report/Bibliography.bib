   abstract = {It is often claimed that we do not understand the forces driving the global diversity gradient. However, an extensive literature suggests that contemporary climate constrains terrestrial taxonomic richness over broad geographic extents. Here, we review the empirical literature to examine the nature and form of the relationship between climate and richness. Our goals were to document the support for the climatically based energy hypothesis, and within the constraints imposed by correlative analyses, to evaluate two versions of the hypothesis: the productivity and ambient energy hypotheses. Focusing on studies extending over 800 km, we found that measures of energy, water, or water?energy balance explain spatial variation in richness better than other climatic and non-climatic variables in 82 of 85 cases. Even when considered individually and in isolation, water/energy variables explain on average over 60% of the variation in the richness of a wide range of plant and animal groups. Further, water variables usually represent the strongest predictors in the tropics, subtropics, and warm temperate zones, whereas energy variables (for animals) or water?energy variables (for plants) dominate in high latitudes. We conclude that the interaction between water and energy, either directly or indirectly (via plant productivity), provides a strong explanation for globally extensive plant and animal diversity gradients, but for animals there also is a latitudinal shift in the relative importance of ambient energy vs. water moving from the poles to the equator. Although contemporary climate is not the only factor influencing species richness and may not explain the diversity pattern for all taxonomic groups, it is clear that understanding water?energy dynamics is critical to future biodiversity research. Analyses that do not include water?energy variables are missing a key component for explaining broad-scale patterns of diversity.},

   abstract = {In recent decades, entomologists have documented alarming declines in occurrence, taxonomic richness, and geographic range of insects around the world. Additionally, some recent studies have reported that insect abundance and biomass, often of common species, are rapidly declining, which has led some to dub the phenomenon an “Insect Apocalypse”. Recent reports are sufficiently robust to justify immediate actions to protect insect biodiversity worldwide. We caution, however, that we do not yet have the data to assess large-scale spatial patterns in the severity of insect trends. Most documented collapses are from geographically restricted studies and, alone, do not allow us to draw conclusions about insect declines on continental or global scales, especially with regards to future projections of total insect biomass, abundance, and extinction. There are many challenges to understanding insect declines: only a small fraction of insect species have had any substantial population monitoring, millions of species remain unstudied, and most of the long-term population data for insects come from human-dominated landscapes in western and northern Europe. But there are still concrete steps we can take to improve our understanding of potential declines. Here, we review the challenges scientists face in documenting insect population and diversity trends, including communicating their findings, and recommend research approaches needed to address these challenges.},

In this study, we test several general diversity hypotheses as they relate to hermatypic corals by examining the relationships between coral generic richness at 130 sites worldwide and descriptors of the environment that would be suggested by the hypotheses. The best environmental predictors of diversity are mean annual ocean temperature and an estimate of regional coral biomass, which suggests that available energy limits regional generic richness. In contrast, we found little evidence supporting other ecological hypotheses, including the hypotheses that disturbance or environmental stability is an important control of diversity. We also investigated historical hypotheses proposed to explain coral distributions. We found a relationship between coral richness and up-current island density that is consistent with vicariance models of speciation and theories of coral dispersal. Using multiple regression, 71% of the variation in coral generic richness could be statistically explained using a combination of variables representing both ecological and historical factors. Similar patterns exist for both coral species and reef fishes.},

   abstract = {Nature is under siege. In the last 10,000 y the human population has grown from 1 million to 7.8 billion. Much of Earth’s arable lands are already in agriculture (1), millions of acres of tropical forest are cleared each year (2, 3), atmospheric CO2 levels are at their highest concentrations in more than 3 million y (4), and climates are erratically and steadily changing from pole to pole, triggering unprecedented droughts, fires, and floods across continents. Indeed, most biologists agree that the world has entered its sixth mass extinction event, the first since the end of the Cretaceous Period 66 million y ago, when more than 80% of all species, including the nonavian dinosaurs, perished.

Ongoing losses have been clearly demonstrated for better-studied groups of organisms. Terrestrial vertebrate population sizes and ranges have contracted by one-third, and many mammals have experienced range declines of at least 80% over the last century (5). A 2019 assessment suggests that half of all amphibians are imperiled (2.5% of which have recently gone extinct) (6). Bird numbers across North America have fallen by 2.9 billion since 1970 (7). Prospects for the world’s coral reefs, beyond the middle of this century, could scarcely be more dire (8). A 2020 United Nations report estimated that more than a million species are in danger of extinction over the next few decades (9), but also see the more bridled assessments in refs. 10 and 11.

Although a flurry of reports has drawn attention to declines in insect abundance, biomass, species richness, and range sizes (e.g., refs. 12⇓⇓⇓⇓⇓–18; for reviews see refs. 19 and 20), whether the rates of declines for insects are on par with or exceed those for other groups remains unknown.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The taxon Lepidoptera is one of the most widespread and recognisable insect orders with 160,000 species worldwide and with more than 20,000 species in Africa. Lepidoptera have a complete metamorphosis and the adults (butterflies and moths) are quite different from the larvae (caterpillars). The purpose of the study was to make an overview of how butterflies/moths and caterpillars are utilised, perceived and experienced in daily life across sub-Saharan Africa. METHOD: Ethno-entomological information on Lepidoptera in sub-Saharan Africa was collected by (1) interviews with more than 300 people from about 120 ethnic groups in 27 countries in the region; and (2) library studies in Africa, London, Paris and Leiden. RESULTS: Often the interviewees indicated that people from his or her family or ethnic group did not know that caterpillars turn into butterflies and moths (metamorphosis). When known, metamorphosis may be used as a symbol for transformation, such as in female puberty or in literature regarding societal change. Vernacular names of the butterfly/moth in the Muslim world relate to religion or religious leaders. The names of the caterpillars often refer to the host plant or to their characteristics or appearance. Close to 100 caterpillar species are consumed as food. Wild silkworm species, such as Borocera spp. in Madagascar and Anaphe species in the rest of Africa, provide expensive textiles. Bagworms (Psychidae) are sometimes used as medicine. Ancestors may be associated with certain dark nocturnal moths, but these are also considered to be responsible for armyworms plagues. The appearance of butterflies/moths can be associated with seasons or serve as predictor of events. There are many proverbs, songs and stories related to butterflies and moths. Lepidoptera are also an inspiration in art expressions. In dance, the movements of caterpillars are used as examples, while certain cocoons are used as rattles. CONCLUSION: Lepidoptera are found very appealing because of the striking appearance of the adults, their dramatic metamorphosis and the provision of silk and nutritious food. Besides, they are an inspiration in art and literature.},

In addition, few art historians deal with insects, and books and other publications on the subject are rare. This rarity of publications extends to those dealing explicitly with insects in western art (i.e., art from Europe and North America). For example, Hutchinson (1974) includes the representation of insects in the works of a medieval European manuscript illustrator, Rothschild (1991) shows a selected number of works, Sear (1993) provides a short communication on the occurrence of insects in the work of the graphic artist Maurits Escher (1898–1972), and Berenbaum (1995, pp. 321–323) mentions a variety of highlights among the works with insects.},

   abstract = {Urbanization induces rapid landscape and habitat modifications leading to alterations in species distribution patterns and biodiversity loss. As pollinating insects such as butterflies are particularly susceptible to urbanization, it is important to pinpoint the factors that could enhance their diversity in the urban areas in order to design adequate management and conservation actions. Our study aims to investigate the influence of land cover and local habitat characteristics on the butterfly diversity patterns and community structure in a densely built city in the eastern Mediterranean region. We carried out butterfly surveys (line transects) in 45 randomly selected sites, distributed along an urbanization gradient. In each site, we assessed the surrounding landscape by measuring the land cover in a 200-m buffer zone, and the local habitat by estimating the available plant resources along each transect. Overall, 1805 individuals belonging to 41 butterfly species were recorded. Land cover was found to have the strongest influence on butterfly species richness, abundance and community structure. Although plant resources were sufficiently available within the whole study area, the butterfly community was significantly poorer in the more urbanized areas, indicating the potential role of habitat fragmentation and patch isolation. In contrast, butterfly diversity was significantly higher in the peri-urban area, underlying its conservation value for butterflies in the urban landscape. We attribute these findings to the degradation of the more urbanized areas due to long-term inadequate planning and the disorganized expansion of the city.},

We also evaluated these effects separately by butterfly guilds based on their region-wide rarity and on degree of specialization. The distribution of abundances of the 44 species observed showed an excess of uncommon species compared to a log-normal distribution, and the two most abundant species were exotic (Thymelicus lineola and Pieris rapae). We used an information theoretic approach to model selection to determine the most important correlates of butterfly species richness. Models of mean butterfly richness per visit explained greater variance than did models of cumulative richness across the season. Cumulative butterfly species richness was affected more at larger spatial scales, while richness per visit was affected similarly at all spatial scales. The most consistent local factor affecting butterfly diversity was the number of nectar producing plants that were flowering. The most consistent landscape-level correlates of species richness were number of people (at small spatial scales) and green space. Measures of increased urbanization were associated with decreased butterfly species richness, and rare and specialized species were most affected. Species that were regionally rare, and those that specialized both in host plants and had few broods, disappeared with declining richness across sites 2.9–4.5 times faster than did generalists and less restricted specialists.},

   abstract = {During the last 50 years, the distribution and abundance of many European butterfly species associated with semi-natural grasslands have declined. This may be the result of deteriorating habitat quality, but habitat loss, resulting in decreasing area and increasing isolation of remaining habitat, is also predicted to result in reduced species richness. To investigate the effects of habitat loss on species richness, we surveyed butterflies in semi-natural grasslands of similar quality and structure, but situated in landscapes of different habitat composition. Using spatially explicit habitat data, we selected one large (6–10 ha) and one small (0.5–2 ha) grassland site (pasture) in each of 24 non-overlapping 28.2 km2 landscapes belonging to three categories differing in the proportion of the area that consisted of semi-natural grasslands. After controlling for local habitat quality, species richness was higher in grassland sites situated in landscapes consisting of a high proportion of grasslands. Species richness was also higher in larger grassland sites, and this effect was more pronounced for sedentary than for mobile species. However, the number of species for a given area did not differ between large and small grasslands. There was also a significant relationship between butterfly species richness and habitat quality in the form of vegetation height and abundance of flowers. In contrast, butterfly density was not related to landscape composition or grassland size. When species respond differently to habitat area or landscape composition this leads to effects on community structure, and nestedness analysis showed that depauperate communities were subsets of richer ones. Both grassland area and landscape composition may have contributed to this pattern, implying that small habitat fragments and landscapes with low proportions of habitat are both likely to mainly contain common generalist species. Based on these results, conservation efforts should aim at preserving landscapes with high proportions of the focal habitat.},

Despite the enormous attention given to SAR in the form of many individual analyses, little attempt has been made to synthesize these studies. We conducted a quantitative meta-analysis of 794 SAR, comprising a wide span of organisms, habitats and locations. We identified factors reflecting both pattern-based and dynamic approaches to SAR and tested whether these factors leave significant imprints on the slope and strength of SAR. Our analysis revealed that SAR are significantly affected by variables characterizing the sampling scheme, the spatial scale, and the types of organisms or habitats involved. We found that steeper SAR are generated at lower latitudes and by larger organisms. SAR varied significantly between nested and independent sampling schemes and between major ecosystem types, but not generally between the terrestrial and the aquatic realm. Both the fit and the slope of the SAR were scale-dependent. We conclude that factors dynamically regulating species richness at different spatial scales strongly affect the shape of SAR. We highlight important consequences of this systematic variation in SAR for ecological theory, conservation management and extinction risk predictions. © 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

Abundance and species richness were highest at low elevations and declined with increasing altitude, while the converse held for habitat breadth. The chorological index was highest at low elevations. Changes in the butterfly communities along the altitudinal gradient of the Sierra de Javalambre are caused by harshness of environmental conditions, changes in the vegetation, and presumably, resource impoverishment. High elevations do not "select' for a endemic fauna of butterflies, whereas the communities in the lowest places are composed of rare and localised species. -from Authors},

   abstract = {The species-area relationship is one of the central generalizations in ecology; however, its origin has remained a puzzle. Since ecosystems are understood as energy transduction systems, the regularities in species richness are considered to result from ubiquitous imperatives in energy transduction. From a thermodynamic point of view, organisms are transduction mechanisms that distribute an influx of energy down along the steepest gradients to the ecosystem&#39;s diverse repositories of chemical energy, that is, populations of species. Transduction machineries, that is, ecosystems assembled from numerous species, may emerge and evolve toward high efficiency on large areas that hold more matter than small ones. This results in the well-known logistic-like relationship between the area and the number of species. The species-area relationship is understood, in terms of thermodynamics, to be the skewed cumulative curve of chemical energy distribution that is commonly known as the species-abundance relationship.},

   abstract = {We analyse distribution records for 51 British butterfly species to investigate altitudinal and latitudinal responses to twentieth century climate warming. Species with northern and/or montane distributions have disappeared from low elevation sites and colonized sites at higher elevations during the twentieth century, consistent with a climate explanation. We found no evidence for a systematic shift northwards across all species, even though 11 out of 46 southerly distributed species have expanded in the northern part of their distributions. For a subset of 35 species, we model the role of climate in limiting current European distributions and predict potential future distributions for the period 2070-2099. Most northerly distributed species will have little opportunity to expand northwards and will disappear from areas in the south, resulting in reduced range sizes. Southerly distributed species will have the potential to shift northwards, resulting in similar or increased range sizes. However, 30 out of 35 study species have failed to track recent climate changes because of lack of suitable habitat, so we revised our estimates accordingly for these species and predicted 65% and 24% declines in range sizes for northern and southern species, respectively. These revised estimates are likely to be more realistic predictions of future butterfly range sizes.},

Using a spatial database for 6336 tropical reef fishes, we attempted to predict species richness according to geometric, biogeographical and environmental explanatory variables. In particular, we aimed to evaluate and disentangle the predictive performances of temperature, habitat area, connectivity, mid-domain effect and biogeographical region on reef fish species richness. We used boosted regression trees, a flexible machine-learning technique, to build our predictive model and structural equation modeling to test for potential ?mediation effects? among predictors. Our model proved to be accurate, explaining 80% of the total deviance in fish richness using a cross-validated procedure. Coral reef area and biogeographical region were the primary predictors of reef fish species richness, followed by coast length, connectivity, mid-domain effect and sea surface temperature, with interactions between the region and other predictors. Important indirect effects of water temperature on reef fish richness, mediated by coral reef area, were also identified. The relationship between environmental predictors and species richness varied markedly among biogeographical regions. Our analysis revealed that a few easily accessible variables can accurately predict reef fish species richness. They also highlight concerns regarding ongoing environmental declines, with region-specific responses to variation in environmental conditions predicting a variable response to anthropogenic impacts.},

   abstract = {It is often claimed that we do not understand the forces driving the global diversity gradient. However, an extensive literature suggests that contemporary climate constrains terrestrial taxonomic richness over broad geographic extents. Here, we review the empirical literature to examine the nature and form of the relationship between climate and richness. Our goals were to document the support for the climatically based energy hypothesis, and within the constraints imposed by correlative analyses, to evaluate two versions of the hypothesis: the productivity and ambient energy hypotheses. Focusing on studies extending over 800 km, we found that measures of energy, water, or water?energy balance explain spatial variation in richness better than other climatic and non-climatic variables in 82 of 85 cases. Even when considered individually and in isolation, water/energy variables explain on average over 60% of the variation in the richness of a wide range of plant and animal groups. Further, water variables usually represent the strongest predictors in the tropics, subtropics, and warm temperate zones, whereas energy variables (for animals) or water?energy variables (for plants) dominate in high latitudes. We conclude that the interaction between water and energy, either directly or indirectly (via plant productivity), provides a strong explanation for globally extensive plant and animal diversity gradients, but for animals there also is a latitudinal shift in the relative importance of ambient energy vs. water moving from the poles to the equator. Although contemporary climate is not the only factor influencing species richness and may not explain the diversity pattern for all taxonomic groups, it is clear that understanding water?energy dynamics is critical to future biodiversity research. Analyses that do not include water?energy variables are missing a key component for explaining broad-scale patterns of diversity.},

   abstract = {We present a unifying framework for information theoretic feature selection, bringing almost two decades of research on heuristic filter criteria under a single theoretical interpretation. This is in response to the question: "what are the implicit statistical assumptions of feature selection criteria based on mutual information?". To answer this, we adopt a different strategy than is usual in the feature selection literature-instead of trying to define a criterion, we derive one, directly from a clearly specified objective function: the conditional likelihood of the training labels. While many hand-designed heuristic criteria try to optimize a definition of feature 'relevancy' and 'redundancy', our approach leads to a probabilistic framework which naturally incorporates these concepts. As a result we can unify the numerous criteria published over the last two decades, and show them to be low-order approximations to the exact (but intractable) optimisation problem. The primary contribution is to show that common heuristics for information based feature selection (including Markov Blanket algorithms as a special case) are approximate iterative maximisers of the conditional likelihood. A large empirical study provides strong evidence to favour certain classes of criteria, in particular those that balance the relative size of the relevancy/redundancy terms. Overall we conclude that the JMI criterion (Yang and Moody, 1999; Meyer et al., 2008) provides the best tradeoff in terms of accuracy, stability, and flexibility with small data samples.},

The key prediction is that species' ranges should move both polewards in latitude and upwards in elevation 4-7-To date, published claims of species' range shifts have extrapolated regional patterns from observations on a small part of a species' range. These studies all assume that changes in population density at a point 8-11 or movement of a boundary at one latitudinal end of a range 12 .1 3 can be unambiguously interpreted as range shifts, rather than as merely local density changes, range expansions or contractions. Reliable evidence for range shifts must include examination of a species' entire range. I report here the first study to provide evidence of the predicted range shifts. I censused populations of Edith's checkerspot butterfly (Euphyd,yas editha) throughout its range, and found significant latitudinal and attitudinal dines in FIG. 1 Map of censused sites. Extinct populations are shown by red triangles, present populations by blue triangles. Because of space limitations, three cen-sused populations in Colorado are not shown but are available from the author on request. I compiled historical population records from museum specimens, private collections and researchers' field notes. Between 1992 and 1996 , I censused 115 sites with historical records to classify their current status as extinct or intact, and for 36 additional sites determined current status using information provided by. I controlled for time elapsed since the initial record by sampling sites within each geographic region that represented the range of historically recorded dates. I did not census sites that: (1) could not be unambiguously located from the records; or (2) were degraded by loss of usable host plants. I censused all butterfly life stages at each included site, and considered sites less than 5 km apart to be part of the same population 17 • I visited sites during the flight season and searched for adults in suitable habitat within the general vicinity of the historical record (resulting in areas of 0 .25 km 2 to 24 km 2 searched). If I fou nd no adults , I population extinctions at sites undegraded by human activities, producing a north-wards and upwards shift in the species' range. I documented extinction and persistence in 151 previously recorded populations of this butterfly, and excluded from the data set all sites where butterfly habitat was degraded and no longer usable by this species, including sites altered by human activities such as land-clearing, construction, overgrazing and introduction of exotic plants. Dense populations of this butterfly have persisted even in moderately disturbed (grazed or logged) sites, if enough suitable host plants remain. Edith's checkerspot occurs as a mosaic of sedentary, discrete populations with intermittent colonizations, extinctions and re-colonizations 14-17 • At equilibrium, the rate of extinction should be constant and equal to the rate of colonization and recolonization.

It is the net extinction rate that is of interest in the context of global warming. I found a striking latitudinal dine in net extinction rates (Figs 1, 2a; P = 0.009). Sites where previously recorded populations still existed were on average 2° further north than sites where populations were extinct. Populations in Mexico were four times more likely to be extinct than those in Canada. Net extinctions also significantly decreased with altitude (Figs 1, 2.b, P = 0.04). Populations above 2,400 m were significantly more persistent than those at all lower elevations (P = 0.016). Although a predicted result of climate warming is an increased extinction rate at the very lowest elevations, no such trend appears in the data. Any factor affecting recolonization might vary systematically and produce the observed dines in net extinctions. However , recolonization was rare over long time periods and over a large portion of the range. Among 31 populations that were repeatedly visited after a recorded extinction , a maximum of 13 % were recolonized over a 30-year period. Further, the degree of isolation of populations (which would directly affect recolonizations) was historically similar at the extremes of the range. Over the past century, records documented 0.32 populations per 1,000 km 2 in mainland Canada and 0.87 populations per 1,000 krn 2 in Mexico (density estimates restricted to the species range in each area). Recent human destruction of butterfly habitat and extirpation of populations could, by increasing isolation, reduce recolonization rates and inflate net extinction rates even in undegraded habitats.

   abstract = {We examined the response of montane butterflies to a 1300-m elevational gradient in the Toiyabe Range, a mountain range in the central Great Basin. We tested whether elevational ranges of montane butterflies conform to Rapoport?s elevational rule (species at higher elevations have greater elevational ranges). We also tested whether the Rapoport-rescue hypothesis (emigrants from higher elevation populations inflate the species richness of lower-elevation sites) could explain the species richness patterns we observed. In addition, we predicted whether global climate change is likely to perturb current elevational gradients in butterfly species richness. Species presence data were collected from 105 100-m vertical elevational bands in 17 canyons. Elevation and species richness were significantly negatively correlated, although species richness peaked at intermediate elevations, and butterflies in species-rich areas had significantly narrower elevational ranges than species in more depauperate areas. Toiyabe Range butterflies conformed to Rapoport?s elevational rule. The Rapoport effect we documented did not result from sampling bias. However, the Rapoport-rescue hypothesis cannot fully explain the elevational gradient in species richness. Environmental severity at either end and favorable conditions near the middle of the elevational gradient likely contributed to high species richness at intermediate elevations. Our models indicated that few butterfly taxa will be lost from the Toiyabe Range in the face of climate change. To maintain present species richness and maximize the potential of Great Basin butterflies to adapt to rapid climate change, we recommend that habitat protection and restoration efforts target not only high elevation Wilderness Areas but also intermediate elevations.},

   abstract = {Two artificial neural networks (ANNs), unsupervised and supervised learning algorithms, were applied to suggest practical approaches for the analysis of ecological data. Four major aquatic insect orders (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera, and Coleoptera, i.e. EPTC), and four environmental variables (elevation, stream order, distance from the source, and water temperature) were used to implement the models. The data were collected and measured at 155 sampling sites on streams of the Adour-Garonne drainage basin (South-western France). The modelling procedure was carried out following two steps. First, a self-organizing map (SOM), an unsupervised ANN, was applied to classify sampling sites using EPTC richness. Second, a backpropagation algorithm (BP), a supervised ANN, was applied to predict EPTC richness using a set of four environmental variables. The trained SOM classified sampling sites according to a gradient of EPTC richness, and the groups obtained corresponded to geographic regions of the drainage basin and characteristics of their environmental variables. The SOM showed its convenience to analyze relationships among sampling sites, biological attributes, and environmental variables. After accounting for the relationships in data sets, the BP used to predict the EPTC richness with a set of four environmental variables showed a high accuracy (r = 0.91 and r = 0.61 for training and test data sets respectively). The prediction of EPTC richness is thus a valuable tool to assess disturbances in given areas: by knowing what the EPTC richness should be, we can determine the degree to which disturbances have altered it. The results suggested that methodologies successively using two different neural networks are helpful to understand ecological data through ordination first, and then to predict target variables. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

   abstract = {[Aim We developed a model enabling us to evaluate the contribution of both natural and human-related factors to butterfly species richness in Catalonia, a Mediterranean area that harbours one of the most diverse butterfly faunas in Europe. Location The study was carried out in Catalonia (north-east Iberian Peninsula), a region of 31,930 km2 lying between the Pyrenees, the Ebro depression and the Mediterranean sea. Methods Data from the Catalan Butterfly Monitoring Scheme were used to assess butterfly species richness from 55 transects spread all over the region. Three groups of environmental variables likely to affect the presence of butterfly species were calculated, above all from geographic information system data: (1) climatology and topography, (2) vegetation structure and (3) human disturbance. Because climatic and topographic variables are expected to be strongly correlated, we first performed a principal component analysis (PCA) to create a summarizing factor that would account for most of the variance within this set of variables. Subsequently, a backward stepwise multiple regression was performed in order to assess the effects of environmental factors on butterfly species richness. Results A total of 131 species were detected in the monitoring transects, representing 75.7% of the butterfly fauna known from Catalonia. Mean species richness per transect and per year was 41.4, although values varied greatly among sites (range: 14-76.8). The final regression model explained more than 80% of the total variance, which indicated a strong association between butterfly species richness and the studied environmental factors. The model revealed the very important contribution of climatic and topographic variables, which were combined into a single factor in the PCA. In contrast to what has been found in other, more northerly countries, species richness was negatively correlated with temperature and positively correlated with rainfall, except for extreme cold and wet conditions. This may be a consequence of the predictably adverse effects of the Mediterranean summer drought on herbivorous insects, and the fact that the limits of distribution of many butterflies correlate well with climatic variables. Human disturbance (defined as the proportion of urban and agricultural landscape cover in buffer areas of 5 km around the transect sites) was the second most important predictor for species richness. We found that a significant decrease in species numbers was associated with an increase in human pressure, a finding that indicates that not only building development, but also modern-day agricultural practices are detrimental to the conservation of Mediterranean butterflies. Surprisingly, vegetation variables had an almost negligible effect on butterfly species richness. Main conclusions Our findings strongly indicate that the current motors of global change will have a negative effect on Mediterranean butterfly assemblages. First, changes in land-use are transforming and fragmenting the landscape into an inhospitable and less permeable matrix for butterflies. Secondly, the negative correlation between species richness and temperature will lead to a predictable loss of diversity over the coming years, as predicted in the most plausible scenarios of climate change. Considering the high butterfly richness characterizing the Mediterranean Basin, this future trend will pose a serious threat to biodiversity.]},

This is of particular concern because there is growing evidence that human well-being is enhanced by exposure to nature. However, the specific qualities of greenspaces that offer the greatest benefits remain poorly understood. One possibility is that humans respond positively to increased levels of biodiversity. Here, we demonstrate the lack of a consistent relationship between actual plant, butterfly, and bird species richness and the psychological well-being of urban greenspace visitors. Instead, well-being shows a positive relationship with the richness that the greenspace users perceived to be present. One plausible explanation for this discrepancy, which we investigate, is that people generally have poor biodiversity-identification skills. The apparent importance of perceived species richness and the mismatch between reality and perception pose a serious challenge for aligning conservation and human well-being agendas. © 2012 by American Institute of Biological Sciences.

   abstract = {We estimated global fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations using information from satellite-, simulation- and monitor-based sources by applying a Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) to global geophysically based satellite-derived PM2.5 estimates. Aerosol optical depth from multiple satellite products (MISR, MODIS Dark Target, MODIS and SeaWiFS Deep Blue, and MODIS MAIAC) was combined with simulation (GEOS-Chem) based upon their relative uncertainties as determined using ground-based sun photometer (AERONET) observations for 1998-2014. The GWR predictors included simulated aerosol composition and land use information. The resultant PM2.5 estimates were highly consistent (R2 = 0.81) with out-of-sample cross-validated PM2.5 concentrations from monitors. The global population-weighted annual average PM2.5 concentrations were 3-fold higher than the 10 μg/m3 WHO guideline, driven by exposures in Asian and African regions. Estimates in regions with high contributions from mineral dust were associated with higher uncertainty, resulting from both sparse ground-based monitoring, and challenging conditions for retrieval and simulation. This approach demonstrates that the addition of even sparse ground-based measurements to more globally continuous PM2.5 data sources can yield valuable improvements to PM2.5 characterization on a global scale.

   abstract = {[The number of species in an area is critical to the development of evolutionary and ecological theory from mass extinctions to island biogeography. Still, the factors influencing the accuracy of estimators of species richness are poorly understood. We explored these factors by simulating landscapes that varied in species richness, relative abundances, and the spatial distribution. We compared the extrapolations of nine nonparametric estimators and two species accumulation curves under three sampling intensities. Community evenness of species' abundances, sampling intensity, and the level of true species richness significantly influenced bias, precision, and accuracy of the estimations. Perhaps most surprisingly, the effects of gradient strength and spatial autocorrelation type were generally insignificant. The nonparametric estimators were substantially less biased and more precise than the species accumulation curves. Observed species richness was most biased. Community evenness, sampling intensity, and the level of true species richness influenced the performance of the nonparametric estimators indirectly via the fraction of all species found in a sample or "sample coverage." For each particular level of sample coverage, a single estimator was most accurate. Choice of estimator is confounded by a priori uncertainty about the sample coverage. Accordingly, researchers can extrapolate species richness by various estimators and base the estimator choice on the mean estimated sample coverage. Alternatively, the most reliable estimator with respect to community evenness can be chosen. These predictions from our simulations are confirmed in two field studies.]},

There are accurate methods for estimating MI that avoid problems with "binning" when both data sets are discrete or when both data sets are continuous. We present an accurate, non-binning MI estimator for the case of one discrete data set and one continuous data set. This case applies when measuring, for example, the relationship between base sequence and gene expression level, or the effect of a cancer drug on patient survival time. We also show how our method can be adapted to calculate the Jensen-Shannon divergence of two or more data sets. © 2014 Brian C. Ross.},

	abstract = {How many species in a given taxon should be found in a delimited area in a specified place in the world? Some recent literature suggests that the answer to this question depends strongly on the geographical, evolutionary, and ecological context. For example, current theory suggests that species accumulate as a function of area differently on continents and islands. Species richness-climate relationships have been examined separately on continents and on islands. This study tests the hypotheses that (1) the functional relationship between richness and climate is the same on continents and islands; (2) the species-area slope depends on distance-based isolation; (3) species-area relationships differ among land bridge islands, oceanic islands, and continents; (4) richness differs among biogeographic regions independently of climate and isolation. We related bird species numbers in a worldwide sample of 240 continental parcels and 346 islands to several environmental variables. We found that breeding bird richness varies similarly on islands and on continents as a function of mean annual temperature, an area x precipitation interaction, and the distance separating insular samples from the nearest continent (R2 = 0.86). Most studies to date have postulated that the slope of the species-area relationship depends upon isolation. In contrast, we found no such interaction. A richness-environment relationship derived using Old World sites accurately predicts patterns of richness in the New World and vice versa (R2 = 0.85). Our results suggest that most of the global variation in richness is not strongly context-specific; rather, it reflects a small number of general environmental constraints operating on both continents and islands.},

	abstract = {Feature selection is one of the most fundamental problems in machine learning. An extensive body of work on information-theoretic feature selection exists which is based on maximizing mutual information between subsets of features and class labels. Practical methods are forced to rely on approximations due to the difficulty of estimating mutual information. We demonstrate that approximations made by existing methods are based on unrealistic assumptions. We formulate a more flexible and general class of assumptions based on variational distributions and use them to tractably generate lower bounds for mutual information. These bounds define a novel information-theoretic framework for feature selection, which we prove to be optimal under tree graphical models with proper choice of variational distributions. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed method strongly outperforms existing information-theoretic feature selection approaches.},

	abstract = {A common problem in machine learning and pattern recognition is the process of identifying the most relevant features, specifically in dealing with high-dimensional datasets in bioinformatics. In this paper, we propose a new feature selection method, called Singular-Vectors Feature Selection (SVFS). Let \$\$D= [A {\textbackslash}mid {\textbackslash}mathbf \{b\}]\$\$be a labeled dataset, where \$\${\textbackslash}mathbf \{b\}\$\$is the class label and features (attributes) are columns of matrix A. We show that the signature matrix \$\$S\_A=I-A{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}dagger \}A\$\$can be used to partition the columns of A into clusters so that columns in a cluster correlate only with the columns in the same cluster. In the first step, SVFS uses the signature matrix \$\$S\_D\$\$of D to find the cluster that contains \$\${\textbackslash}mathbf \{b\}\$\$. We reduce the size of A by discarding features in the other clusters as irrelevant features. In the next step, SVFS uses the signature matrix \$\$S\_A\$\$of reduced A to partition the remaining features into clusters and choose the most important features from each cluster. Even though SVFS works perfectly on synthetic datasets, comprehensive experiments on real world benchmark and genomic datasets shows that SVFS exhibits overall superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art feature selection methods in terms of accuracy, running time, and memory usage. A Python implementation of SVFS along with the datasets used in this paper are available at https://github.com/Majid1292/SVFS.},

	abstract = {Studying how the environment shapes current biodiversity patterns in species rich regions is a fundamental issue in biogeography, ecology, and conservation. However, in the Neotropics, the study of the forces driving species distribution and richness, is mostly based on vertebrates and plants. In this study, we used 54,392 georeferenced records for 46 species and 1,012 georeferenced records for 38 interspecific hybrids of the Neotropical Heliconius butterflies to investigate the role of the environment in shaping their distribution and richness, as well as their geographic patterns of phylogenetic diversity and phylogenetic endemism. We also evaluated whether niche similarity promotes hybridization in Heliconius. We found that these insects display five general distribution patterns mostly explained by precipitation and isothermality, and to a lesser extent, by altitude. Interestingly, altitude plays a major role as a predictor of species richness and phylogenetic diversity, while precipitation explains patterns of phylogenetic endemism. We did not find evidence supporting the role of the environment in facilitating hybridization because hybridizing species do not necessarily share the same climatic niche despite some of them having largely overlapping geographic distributions. Overall, we confirmed that, as in other organisms, high annual temperature, a constant supply of water, and spatio-topographic complexity are the main predictors of diversity in Heliconius. However, future studies at large scale need to investigate the effect of microclimate variables and ecological interactions.},
